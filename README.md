# GoogleAppsScriptLibrary

This repository is a collection of documents written in [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/). Google Apps Script allows you to write scripts in Google Drive (very similar to how you might make a document in Google Drive) that interacts natively with a variety of Google services (e.g. Sheets, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, etc). Not only that, but there are also ways to have your script interact with full APIs of those services (e.g. YouTube, Maps, etc) or even external services (in this repository I have examples for [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/), & [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/))

Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/derekantrican/Google-Apps-Script-Library/issues) here to report issues with these scripts. You can also contact me at derekantrican@gmail.com and I can help you troubleshoot a problem
